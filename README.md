#Persian Pdf with weasy-print sample

-if you are usin django, and need to write some persian/farsi data to a pdf file, and you need some specific font, you can use this sample to know ho to do it.

*NOTE that non of other python pdf makers can not print persian stuff. it takes me three days to test each one. so use weasy-print and do not waste your time.

- first part of code is about rendering some value to a django template and get it as html string.

- secont part of code is printing a html page to a pdf, exactly as it appears on web browser.(with whole css rules and font families)
